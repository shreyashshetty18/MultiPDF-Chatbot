# 🧠 MultiPDF Chatbot

**MultiPDF Chatbot** is an AI-powered assistant that allows users to query and extract information from multiple PDF documents using natural language. It leverages semantic search and large language models (LLMs) to provide accurate, context-aware answers from document content—making it ideal for research, business, legal, and technical applications.

## 🧱 System Architecture

1. **PDF Upload** – Users upload one or more PDF documents.
2. **Text Extraction** – Raw text is extracted from each file.
3. **Chunking & Preprocessing** – Extracted text is cleaned and split into smaller segments.
4. **Embedding Generation** – Chunks are embedded into vector representations using transformer models.
5. **Storage** – Embeddings are stored in a FAISS vector index for efficient retrieval.
6. **Query Handling** – User queries are transformed into embeddings.
7. **Semantic Retrieval** – Similar chunks are retrieved based on vector similarity.
8. **Answer Generation** – An LLM generates answers using retrieved chunks as context.
9. **Chat Interface** – Users interact through a Streamlit-based conversational UI.
